# Thermostat challenge etc.

Makers week 5. Challenge to make a thermostat. Completed programming in pairs over the week's afternoons.

I think the stage I/we got to was we were supposed to make a separate API to which you could send the thermostat value. I think I/we did this, but you can't then get it back again...
